Plan and schedule the upcoming weekly team meeting. Create an agenda that includes project updates, team member progress, roadblocks, and upcoming goals. Share the agenda with all participants beforehand and ensure that all necessary resources (like reports or slides) are ready for the discussion. Document the meeting minutes and distribute them to the team after the meeting.
