Develop a detailed monthly budget to track your income and expenses. Categorize your spending into essentials (e.g., rent, groceries, utilities) and discretionary items (e.g., dining out, entertainment). Identify areas where you can save money and set financial goals, such as building an emergency fund or saving for a big purchase. Use tools like spreadsheets or budgeting apps to make it easier to monitor and adjust as needed.
